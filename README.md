        <strong>Adam Morsa</strong><br />
          I'm a creative software engineer with an eye for design. When not coding, I enjoy hiking, camping, and gaming.<br /><br />
          While working on this project, I learned how to organize, blueprint, and delegate an open-source project while getting great practice with passing data back and forth between the client, the server, and the database in an MVC-structured full-stack application.</p>

        <strong>Andrea Pang</strong><br />
          On this project, I increased my familiarity with MVC architecture, GitHub, and the Mongoose library. It also provided an opportunity to apply Agile methodology in an open-source environment and producing an MVP.</p>

          I'm a full stack software engineer who loves working with others to create practical and useful applications. When I am not working I am usually found surfing, climbing or walking in the mountains.
          <br /><br />
          In this project I increased my github knowledge by working on assigned issues and linked pull requests. I also cemented MVC architecture and learned the process of user authentication.</p>
