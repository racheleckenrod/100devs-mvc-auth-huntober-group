        <strong>Adam Morsa</strong><br />
          I'm a creative software engineer with an eye for design. When not coding, I enjoy hiking, camping, and gaming.<br /><br />
          While working on this project, I learned how to organize, blueprint, and delegate an open-source project while getting great practice with passing data back and forth between the client, the server, and the database in an MVC-structured full-stack application.</p>
